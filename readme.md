# GPT-GUI-DART

## Version 0.1

This project, GPT-GUI-DART, aims to create an interactive interface for interacting with DART and a personalized GPT builder via actions. 

### Overview

DART is a web application that provides a variety of functionalities. This project aims to create a Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the DART web app, allowing users to perform various operations such as creating tasks, updating tasks, and beginning tasks[1].

The project also involves the development of a personalized GPT builder. GPT, or Generative Pretrained Transformer, is a type of language model that uses machine learning to generate human-like text. The personalized GPT builder will allow users to create their own GPT models tailored to their specific needs.
